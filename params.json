{"name":"Selenium Sniper","tagline":"Soon-to-be Java-based WPCP Enrichments sniper","body":"# Selenium Sniper\r\nSelenium Sniper is a Python program (will be Java-based soon) that automatically signs you up for pre-chosen [Payton enrichments](http://selenium.wpcp.org/m/) at midnight, ten days in advance (the earliest possible time to sign up for enrichments). Well, technically the \"automatically at midnight\" part is handled by your OS's task scheduler program, but the Java program will just sit there all the time.\r\n## How it works\r\nSelenium doesn't actually have an API, so the mobile site is used (for its simplicity) to log in to the appropriate page at <http://selenium.wpcp.org/m/> then actually sign up for the enrichment.\r\n## Why Selenium?\r\nIt's not actually my choice of name, for the most part. \"Selenium\" is the element whose atomic number is [Payton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Payton) number, 34. **_Selenium Sniper_ has nothing to do with the [Selenium WebDriver system](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)**.\r\n## Where's the Java port, man?\r\nIt's on the way. Originally, I wrote Selenium Sniper in Python, because that's what I knew. The Python version _works_, (except for installation on Windows lol), but I want something more portable. Hopefully, writing a GUI app in Java SE will mean that I could easily port it to Android, and from there I could (again, hopefully) use [J2ObjC](http://j2objc.org/) to port it to an iOS app.\r\n## Do you love me?\r\nYes. :kissing_heart:\r\n## License\r\n_Full license details are available in the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/bmintz/selenium-sniper/LICENSE.md) file._\r\n```\r\nSelenium Sniper: Signs you up for Payton enrichments so you don't have to.\r\nCopyright (C) 2014-2015  Benjamin Mintz\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; version 2\r\nof the License only.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
