# selenium-sniper
Selenium Sniper signs you up for [Payton enrichments](http://selenium.wpcp.org) so you don't have to.

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries:
Those are [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and
[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).
(Someday, I'll make an installer for Windoze noobs.)
2. Edit the included selenium.ini file to your preferences.
Documentation for this is included in the ini file itself.
If all of the text appears to be on one line, you're probably using Notepad on MS Windows.
Don't use Notepad. Notepad++ is loads better. Install it.
